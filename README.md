# TetrisGame
I made this Tetris Game as a class project for the class ‘Advanced Object Oriented Programming’

To play the game, use left, right and down arrow keys to move the Tetris piece to desired direction. To make the piece rotate clockwise, press ‘z’ key; to make it rotate counter clockwise, press ‘x’ key. 

How to run the program:
Download the folder to desktop.
Open Eclipse and import the folder to workspace.
Run the file TetrisGameGUIApplication.java located in src folder.
